    <p class="item">For this blog page it was somewhat challenging taking in so much Information but once you understand how to write HTML
        code it becomes easier.  I have learned some cool stuff when it comes to HTML, like how to  input HTML code manually
        into video studio code. 
        I have also have learned how to name the title of the web pagea in HTML and how to italicize text.
    Furthermore I also learned about attributes that can change the language you write HTML Code.</p>
 <h3>Lesson Learned:</h3>
   
    <p>Web servers which are computers that are designed to host files for web pages, Video studio code is a text editor for html, 
        and Git Hub allows you to share your code.</p>

        <li>Web Servers</li>
        <li>Git Hub</li>
        <li>Video Studio Code</li>
    </ol>
<p>I also learned how to make unordered HTML list:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="index.html">Blog site</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://google.com">Google.com</a></li>

    <p class="highlight">In this reflection i've learned a lot about CSS files. Learning where 
        to put the different ID selectors in a different class was a bit challenging.
        Changing the background and paragraph colors was very fun. 
        Really good resources came from W3Schools. </p>

    <h2 id="lab5">Lab 05</h2>
    
    <h3>Lesson Learn</h3>
    <p class="highlight">In this reflection, I have learned that media query is quite easy to understand. I had a little 
        trouble understanding how to Implement a mobile-friendly single-column layout 
        using CSS flexbox or grid. As well as adding anchor link that allow you to 
        navigate through the page. The thing that helped me the most was going to tutoring 
        through the CSIT Lab on campus. Also, going over the material learned in class lectures. once
        I developed a understanding of embedding the CSS code I understand that it was 
        just little changes that I had to make.
