    <p>For this blog page it was somewhat challenging taking in so much Information but once you understand how to write HTML
        code it becomes easier.  I have learned some cool stuff when it comes to HTML, like how to  input HTML code manually
        into video studio code. 
        I have also have learned how to name the title of the web pagea in HTML and how to italicize text.
    Furthermore I also learned about attributes that can change the language you write HTML Code.</p>

        and Git Hub allows you to share your code.</p>

    <p class="highlight">In this reflection i've learned a lot about CSS files. Learning where to put the 
        different ID selectors in a different class was a bit challenging. Changing the background
        and paragraph colors was very fun. </p>
