    <p>For this blog page it was somewhat challenging taking in so much Information but once you understand how to write HTML
        code it becomes easier.  I have learned some cool stuff when it comes to HTML, like how to  input HTML code manually
        into video studio code. 
        I have also have learned how to name the title of the web pagea in HTML and how to italicize text.
    Furthermore I also learned about attributes that can change the language you write HTML Code.</p>

    <h3>Lesson Learned:</h3>
    <p>Web servers which are computers that are designed to host files for web pages, Video studio code is a text editor for html, 
        and Git Hub allows you to share your code.</p>
