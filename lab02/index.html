    <p>For this blog page it was somewhat challenging taking in so much Information but once you understand how to write HTML
        code it becomes easier.  I have learned some really cool stuff when it comes to html, like how to manually input HTML code 
        into video studio code. 
        I also have learned how to name the title of the web pagea in HTML, as well as learn how to italic text.
    Furthermore I also learned about attributes that can change the language you write HTML Code.</p>
    <h3>Lesson learned:</h3>
    <p>Web servers which are computers that are design to host files for web pages, Video studio code is a text editor for html, 
        and Git Hub allows you to share your code.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Web Servers</li>
        <li>Git Hub</li>
        <li>Video Studio Code</li>
    </ol>
<p>I also learned how to make unordered HTML list:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a> href="">Blog Page</a></li>
    <li><a></a></li>
</ul>
