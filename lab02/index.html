    <h1>CSIT 121 Class Reflection</h1>
    <h2>Labs 1 & 2</h2> 
    <p><i>Published on August 15, 2024 by Markina Smith</i></p>
    <p>For this blog page it was somewhat challenging taking in so much information but once you understand how to write HTML
        code it becomes easier.  I have learned some cool stuff when it comes to HTML, like how to input HTML code manually 
        into video studio code. 
        I have also learned how to name the title of web pages in HTML and how to italicize text.
    Furthermore, I also learned about attributes that can change the language you write HTML Code.</p>
    <h3>Lesson learned:</h3>
    <p>Web servers which are computers that are designed to host files for web pages, Video studio code is a text editor for html, 
        and Git Hub allows you to share your code.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Web Servers</li>
        <li>Git Hub</li>
        <li>Video Studio Code</li>
    </ol>
<p>I also learned how to make an unordered HTML list:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a> href="">Blog Page</a></li>
    <li><a></a></li>
</ul>
