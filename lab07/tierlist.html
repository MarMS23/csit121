    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <p>
        Going through the module was very helpful with 
         understanding this lab assignment. Using W3 schools 
         was very helpful as we'll see the codes from previous 
         classwork for assignments. Forms were a bit hard to understand, 
         but once you Understandthe label and input and value and name 
         it's much easier to understand. As well as have a good understanding 
         of how to enter tables and forms it became much 
         easier to implement the code inside of HTML.
